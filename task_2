Download Epoch AIâ€™s dataset of large-scale AI models. From this, extract a time series showing how the maximum amount of compute used to train any AI system has changed over time. Each entry in your response must represent a training run which, at the time it happened, set a new record for the maximum amount of compute used to train an AI system.

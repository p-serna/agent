# LLM Agent

This is a small repo for an LLM Agent using OpenAI API. The implementation uses tools included in agent/tools.py

To run it, install requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
And run for example:
```
python -m future.agent task_2
```
If you want to use interactive mode run
```
python -m future.agent
```

## TODO
- [ ] Proper python interpreter
  - Issue: security
